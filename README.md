# AutonomousCar-CarroAutonomo
Implementation of an autonomous car with arduino. Implementação de um carro autônomo com arduíno.

This is a simple automation project that has a limited observable ambient due to its limited sensors(for now using only an ultrasonic sensor).

To use this source code with arduino IDE you'll need to create a folder named Robot and place all the files in it.
